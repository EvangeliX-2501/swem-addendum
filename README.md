<h5> This is an addon for SWEM.Â You can summon different SWEM horse breeds and use your own coat textures. This will not work on normal SWEM horses. </h5>
<h6>
Summon a horse (arabian, for example): <code>/summon swemaddendum:arabian</code><br>
Summon a horse with a coat: <code>/summon swemaddendum:arabian ~ ~ ~ {Texture:"template:arabian/coat_name.png"}</code>
</h6>
<h6>
Any texture inside a valid resource pack will work. You can download Template.zip here. Add your own texture to the pack, see it in game.<br>
You can fork this project, I just ask you keep it free for folks to use.
